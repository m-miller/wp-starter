# WP Starter Tweaks

## Common

- Remove WP logo from admin bar
- Remove the `generator` meta tag

## Admin

- Updated footer text
- Always show the current version of WP in the footer, even if there is an upgrade available
- Show a notice if the permissions of `wp-content` are `0777`

## Login

- header link goes to your `url`
- header title is your site name

## Theme directory

- Added another `themes` directory so you can store your themes outside of `wp-content/themes`
